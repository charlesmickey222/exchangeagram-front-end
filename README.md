# EXCHANGE-O-GRAM

# Use our app [here](https://exchangeagram.netlify.app/)

Exchange-o-gram is a social media photo sharing application. After signing up, a user is able to upload photos and display them on the feed page and their profile page. The user is also able to view other users photos on the feed page and like and comment on each photo. If a user wants to message another user directly, they can send and respond to messages from their profile page. Exchange-o-gram makes it easy to keep up with your friend's and family's lives through photo sharing!
